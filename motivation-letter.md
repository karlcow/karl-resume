# Motivation Letter

The motivation letter is a strange and often futile exercise. I would not apply to your (`$COMPANY`||`$ORGANIZATION`) if I was not motivated by working into it. But here a few things that might help you understand me better and know if I'm a good fit. If you have more questions, please feel free to ask in [issues](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/issues?state=open) or [@karlpro](https://twitter.com/karlpro)

## Rockstar, Ninja, Jedi of `$SKILL`

I'm not. You will not find me in celebrity contests. It's not a very interesting place. I'm a learner first. Then I love to communicate, translate what I have learned to others. I love to participate and share. If someone thinks that there is such a place as the ultimate expert in one domain then I don't want to be there, it is a very lonely place.
