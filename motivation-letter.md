# Motivation Letter

The motivation letter is a strange and often futile exercise. I would not apply to your (`$COMPANY`||`$ORGANIZATION`) if I was not motivated by working into it. But here a few things that might help you understand me better and know if I'm a good fit. If you have more questions, please feel free to ask in [issues](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/issues?state=open) or [@karlpro](https://twitter.com/karlpro)
