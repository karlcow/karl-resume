# Motivation Letter

The motivation letter is a strange and often futile exercise. I would not apply to your (`$COMPANY`||`$ORGANIZATION`) if I was not motivated by working into it. But here a few things that might help you understand me better and know if I'm a good fit. If you have more questions, please feel free to ask in [issues](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/issues?state=open) or [@karlpro](https://twitter.com/karlpro). This is a part of my [Open Resume Experiment](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume#readme)

## Rockstar, Ninja, Jedi of `$SKILL`

I'm not. You will not find me in celebrity contests. It's not a very interesting place. I'm a learner first. Then I love to communicate, translate what I have learned to others. I love to participate and share. If someone thinks that there is such a place as the ultimate expert in one domain then I don't want to be there, it is a very lonely place.

## Relocating

I'm ready to relocate to another place in the world for working. I'm currently living in Montr√©al, Canada. I'm a French citizen with a permanent residency in Canada. I currently have the **right to work** in the following areas:

* Canada
* Countries part of the European community
* Japan (with a bit of paper work ~4 weeks)

In the past, I have been working in Canada, France and Japan.

## Remote Working

Often when discussing about remote working, people are focussing on the wrong side of it: employees. I have been working remotely from 2001 to 2005 ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) and from 2010 to 2013 ([Opera Software](http://www.opera.com/)). In my experience, the remote working option is really successful when **everyone in the company is working like if they were remote**, even if coming every day into the office. It has very strong dependencies on internal information architecture and workflow management. It is not necessary easy to do if local employees (including management) do not embrace [work techniques](https://github.com/karlcow/travailtech/issues) allowing remote working.

This includes:

* physical meetings and their documentation (scribing)
* online action items/issues tracking
* remotely accessible and modifiable documentations
* etc.

It may have a very nice twist for the company by improving the information management through [paper trail](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PaperTrail).

## Do Not Contact Me

In the case you are in the position of starting a discussion on a future job proposal, I would love to save your time and my time. I'm open to many jobs proposal, I love to learn but there are a few things which I prefer to keep out of my radar. If the job proposal is related to this list, please do not contact me.

* Personal data profiling on the sole purpose of selling ads.
* Entertainment, Media industry actively pushing for DRMs
* Military industry

## Open Source, Open Projects Contributions

I have been participating to open projects and open source as much as my time and my interests allowed it. This is usually a good way to understand community dynamics and to give back a part of all the wonderful thing that the communities provide to us. A few things, I'm currently participating to or have participated include:

* [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org) including [Translations](http://www.w3.org/2005/11/Translations/Query?rec=any&lang=any&translator=Karl_Dubost&date=any&sorting=byTechnology&output=FullHTML&submit=Submit), [Summary of the Open Web Platform](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Open+Web+Platform+Weekly+Summary%22+site%3Aw3.org%2FQA)
* [OpenWeb](http://www.openweb.eu.org)
* [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) ([French](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:KarlDubost) and [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KarlDubost))
* [Python bugs fixing](http://bugs.python.org/) (Started in 2012, focus on [http bugs](http://bugs.python.org/issue?%40search_text=&ignore=file%3Acontent&title=&%40columns=title&id=&%40columns=id&stage=&creation=&creator=&activity=&%40columns=activity&%40sort=activity&actor=&nosy=karlcow&type=&components=&versions=&dependencies=&assignee=&keywords=&priority=&%40group=priority&status=1&%40columns=status&resolution=&nosy_count=&message_count=&%40pagesize=50&%40startwith=0&%40queryname=&%40old-queryname=&%40action=search).)
* And here and there reporting bugs in other open source projects and providing fix when possible.


## Not On LinkedIn

Two recent and common questions:

* What is your LinkedIn profile?
* We didn't find you on LinkedIn.

I had a LinkedIn profile from June 2009 to August 2011. I decided to close my account when LinkedIn forced its users into an opt-in. Trust is something elementary in any transactions. LinkedIn didn't have the level of trust I would expect from such a site, so I quit.
