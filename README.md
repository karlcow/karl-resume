===========

I'm [Karl Dubost](http://www.la-grange.net/karl/).

This is an experiment at a personal Resume on github with contributions open to people who know me. There are certainly things which need to be polished. But let's ship it, and fix it iteratively.

* [Very Quick Introduction](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/quick-intro.md)
* [Employment History](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/employment.md)
* [Talks and Conferences](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/conferences.md)
* [Articles](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/publications.md)
* Education (not sure it is relevant)
* [References and Testimonials](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/references.md)
* [Motivation letter](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/motivation-letter.md)


## Why? ##

The reasoning started with how difficult and misleading it can be sometimes to describe yourself. So I thought about giving only plain facts about my history and let other people contribute on who I was. It means also that this experiment might fail completely. Without trying, we will never know, so let's see where this goes.

## Contributing  ##

If you think there are things missing on my resume, you are welcome to make pull requests on this directory.

## Questions? ##

If you have questions or specific issues, you are welcome to raise issues in the issues list. It is really an open experiment. If you are an employer and you want to propose a job and you think there are missing details, you can also raise an issue.
