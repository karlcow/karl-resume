Ian Jacobs - W3C Head of Communications

Karl worked at W3C from 2000-2009. During his latter years he
worked with me in the Communications Team. He had a significant
impact on improving our communications and relations with developers,
and contributed to messaging, design, and improving user experiences
with our Web site. To this day, I consult with Karl on topics of
developer relations and getting an insider view of what's happening
on the Web.
