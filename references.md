Description

===============
Ian Jacobs - W3C Head of Communications

Karl worked at W3C from 2000-2009. During his latter years he
worked with me in the Communications Team. He had a significant
impact on improving our communications and relations with developers,
and contributed to messaging, design, and improving user experiences
with our Web site. To this day, I consult with Karl on topics of
developer relations and getting an insider view of what's happening
on the Web.

Rudy Rigot - Managing Director of the start-up Steerious,
founding member of the Sud Web conferences

Although i've never worked directly with Karl, we've been on common conference
projects multiple times, and i've been lucky enough to witness and enjoy his
aura and natural intellectual authority on the French-speaking web-makers'
community. People who naturally express a superior understanding of the web
and whom, at the same time, are able to spread it in a highly understandable
fashion are pretty rare, and there is no question that Karl is one of them. His
ability to have earned the highest respect of such a large community is proof
of his abilities with web science as well as with people, and there is no doubt
it is a honor he deserves entirely.
